    <h1>ðŸŽ¬ Must-watch movies ðŸŽ¬</h1>
    <h3>There are films that everyone should see at least once in their life
    </h3>

    <br />
    <h4><em>This is one of them:</em></h4>
    <p><strong>Murder in the First </strong> (1995) is a film based on events that really happened in the famous American penitentiary of Alcatraz, in San Francisco Bay, around 1940. 
        <br />In the trial of a prisoner, at first arrested as a young man for stealing 5 dollars to buy food for his little sister, and now accused of killing another inmate, the brutality of the treatments given in that prison was publicly denounced, with consequences that marked the history of US penitentiaries.<br />
        The relationship established between the accused and his lawyer will be the only drop of humanity in a sea of bestiality and dishumanization.
